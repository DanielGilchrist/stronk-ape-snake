This game was created entirely by claude with slight edits to fix up some issues. I forgot I had been messing around with context in my profile settings and this was the result with only this prompt:
```
Give me a single file html / javascript snake game. Make it super pretty and fully functional with your score, pause functionality, and make sure that you can't immediately do a 180 and eat yourself!
```
